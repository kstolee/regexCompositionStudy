# regexCompositionStudy
branch njl A study run by Kathryn Stolee where participants are observed as they attempt to satisfy a set of regex composition challenges.  The code in this repo is public, and so does not contain any answers to the challenges, but will contain JUnit4 test code to check each of the challenges for correctness.  The answers are in a separate private repo.
